## Business Understanding

Our clients have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. 

We were charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. 

With that information, we needed to provide actionable insights for the new movie studio to decide what type of films to create.

To provide a well-rounded analysis we used data from prominent film review websites. We additionally added data from Oscar Winners to provide insight on what movies are gaining critical acclaim.
